# Hi, name's Kevin 👋🏼

### A bit about me

I am a software developer, self taught web developer with +2 years of experience and a good eye for design. Being self taught in most things and not following a traditional route in tech has given me great empathy for people of all ability level and backgrounds. Outside of work, I build open source projects, contribute to open source and I enjoy helping others get started in the world of engineering and building products for themselves and others, a cause I feel extremely passionate about.
  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... [Building a peer-to-peer, fashion marketplace](https://github.com/KevinRaleie-dev/threads-ui) and a few other projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... GraphQL.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... really cool projects that'll challenge me.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him

### Technologies I enjoy working with (updated):

- React / Next.js / React native
- GraphQL
- Node.js
- Typescript / Javascript
- SQL -> PostgreSQL ( learning more and more about working with databases )📚
- AWS 

### Technologies I would love to know:

- Vim (to get things done a lot faster)
- A systems language (looking at you [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) 👀
- A functional language (Scala wouldn't be so bad) 🤔
- Learning the cloud and devops, particularly AWS 💭

If you are looking to collaborate 🤝 on a project or looking for a developer, you're more than welcome to reach out to me on twitter, send me a DM and lets have a chat!😊
