### A bit about me

I am a software developer, self taught web developer with +2 years of experience and a good eye for design. Being self taught in most things and not following a traditional route in tech has given me great empathy for people of all ability level and backgrounds. Outside of work, I build open source projects, contribute to open source and I enjoy helping others get started in the world of engineering and building products for themselves and others, a cause I feel extremely passionate about.
