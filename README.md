### A Bit About Me 😬

I am a software developer, self taught web developer with +3 years of experience and a good eye for design. Being self taught in most things and not following a traditional route in tech has given me great empathy for people of all ability level and backgrounds. Outside of work, I build open source projects, contribute to open source, mentor junior devs and I enjoy helping others get started in the world of engineering and building products for themselves and others, a cause I feel extremely passionate about.

Other things that also interest me are K-drama series, currently watching StrongGirl Bong-Soon and my favorite so far has to be Vincenzo ❤️. I'm also great in the kitchen, cooking has been a new found passion for me and i'm enjoying it so far.
